#Full Container Run

The `deploy.sh` file can deploy a container "name of your choice"
with image "name-of-your-choice" on "your-choice" port.

This is for fun only!

As long as docker file compiles successfully this should save some keystrokes :technologist: :woman_technologist:

Just making this world lazy, a file at a time.
